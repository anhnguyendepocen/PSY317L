### A manufacturing company produces metal parts 

# The parts are normally distributed with a length 10mm and SD 0.2mm

# The manager suspects that the manufacturing machine is faulty
# and that the parts are longer than they should be.

# They select a batch of 25 parts.
# the sample mean is 10.1mm 

# is this an unepectedly large mean ?


### Population:  Mean = 10,  SD = 0.2
# Sample:  n = 25,  sample mean = 10.1

x <- 10.1

x

# 1. Our one sample mean is one possible sample mean from the sampling distribution of sample means.

# the sampling distribution has:
# mean = 10
# sd =  0.2 / sqrt(25)
0.2 / sqrt(25)  #SD of sampling distribution (standard error of the mean)

sem <- 0.2 / sqrt(25)

sem



# 2. How many "standard deviations" is our sample mean from the mean of the sampling distribution?

# Calculate the z-score:

(x - 10) / sem

z <- (x - 10) / sem

z


# 3. What proportion of the sampling distribution is higher than +2.5 SDs than the mean?
# same as saying what proportion is 2.5SD higher than 0 in the standard normal curve.


pnorm(z)  # this is the area to the left of the line

1 - pnorm(z)  # p = 0.006209665

# as p <.05, this is good evidence that the sample mean is unexpectedly large.
